A thread that tries to acquire a lock on an object that has a weak identity can be blocked by a second thread in a different application domain that has a lock on the same object. \\\cline{1-7}
17 &C\-A2008 &Do not create tasks without passing a Task\-Scheduler &Reliability &True &True &Do not create tasks unless you are using one of the overloads that takes a Task\-Scheduler. The default is to schedule on Task\-Scheduler.\-Current, which would lead to deadlocks. Either use Task\-Scheduler.\-Default to schedule on the thread pool, or explicitly pass Task\-Scheduler.\-Current to make your intentions clear. \\\cline{1-7}

19 &C\-A2010 &Always consume the value returned by methods marked with Preserve\-Sig\-Attribute &Reliability &True &False &Preserve\-Sig\-Attribute indicates that a method will return an H\-R\-E\-S\-U\-L\-T, rather than throwing an exception. Therefore, it is important to consume the H\-R\-E\-S\-U\-L\-T returned by the method, so that errors can be detected. Generally, this is done by calling Marshal.\-Throw\-Exception\-For\-H\-R. \\\cline{1-7}

If the Server\-Certificate\-Validation\-Callback always returns 'true', any certificate will pass validation. \\\cline{1-7}
58 &C\-A5360 &Do Not Call Dangerous Methods In Deserialization &Security &True &False &Insecure Deserialization is a vulnerability which occurs when untrusted data is used to abuse the logic of an application, inflict a Denial-\/of-\/\-Service (Do\-S) attack, or even execute arbitrary code upon it being deserialized. It’s frequently possible for malicious users to abuse these deserialization features when the application is deserializing untrusted data which is under their control. Specifically, invoke dangerous methods in the process of deserialization. Successful insecure deserialization attacks could allow an attacker to carry out attacks such as Do\-S attacks, authentication bypasses, and remote code execution. \\\cline{1-7}

61 &C\-A5363 &Do Not Disable Request Validation &Security &True &False &Request validation is a feature in A\-S\-P.\-N\-E\-T that examines H\-T\-T\-P requests and determines whether they contain potentially dangerous content. This check adds protection from markup or code in the U\-R\-L query string, cookies, or posted form values that might have been added for malicious purposes. So, it is generally desirable and should be left enabled for defense in depth. \\\cline{1-7}
