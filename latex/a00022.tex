\subsection*{Introduction}

This document lists the other document that comprise the Programming documentation for \hyperlink{a00040}{Yarn} Spinner. Programming \hyperlink{a00040}{Yarn} Spinner is intended to mean coding C\# to achieve the goals set out in \hyperlink{a00040}{Yarn} Dialogue to meet the proudction requirements of producing a game. The game can be produced using any engine, however for now we only document using Unity.

\subsection*{Building}

The \hyperlink{a00119}{Building} assists you in compiling the \hyperlink{a00040}{Yarn} Spinner software. You may need to build \hyperlink{a00040}{Yarn} Spinner yourself, particularly if you wish to test out certain code or use tools (such as ../\-Yarn\-Spinner-\/\-Dialogue/\-Localization.md \char`\"{}\-Localiisation\char`\"{}.

\subsection*{Extending}

The default \hyperlink{a00040}{Yarn} Spinner code may not provide enough functionality for your game, so you will need to extend it by adding your own functions. The \hyperlink{a00120}{Extending} documentation provides an example on how to create custom C\# code to integrate with \href{../YarnSpinner-Dialogue/}{\tt Yarn Dialogue}

\subsubsection*{A\-P\-I Reference}

The \href{https://thesecretlab.github.io/YarnSpinner/html/}{\tt A\-P\-I Reference} is available online for the current release. It's possible to use the build script to create your own. See the \hyperlink{a00119}{Building} documentation for information on how to do this.
