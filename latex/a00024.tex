\subsection*{\hyperlink{a00048}{Yarn} Spinner Quick Start}

Here's how to quickly jump in to \hyperlink{a00048}{Yarn} Spinner if you're already familiar with Unity.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Download} \href{https://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner/releases}{\tt the Yarn\-Spinner package} into your Unity project.
\item {\bfseries Import} the package into your project.
\item Inside the \hyperlink{a00344}{Yarn\-Spinner} folder, {\bfseries open the {\ttfamily Examples/\-Yarn Spinner Basic Example} scene.}
\item {\bfseries Start the game.}
\item {\bfseries Play through the dialogue.}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Once you've played with it, open the Example Script file in the \href{http://github.com/infiniteammoinc/Yarn}{\tt Yarn Editor}, (it's in the {\ttfamily Examples/\-Demo Assets} folder), and make some changes to the script. Once you've done that, take a look at how {\ttfamily \hyperlink{a00269}{Code/\-Dialogue\-Runner.\-cs}}, {\ttfamily Examples/\-Demo \hyperlink{a00273}{Scripts/\-Example\-Dialogue\-U\-I.\-cs}} and {\ttfamily Examples/\-Demo \hyperlink{a00274}{Scripts/\-Example\-Variable\-Storage.\-cs}} work. You can also ../\-Yarn\-Spinner-\/\-Programming/\-Extending.md \char`\"{}add your own functions to Yarn\char`\"{}.
