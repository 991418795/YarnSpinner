\hyperlink{a00026}{Yarn} is a language that's designed to make it {\itshape super easy} to create interactive dialogue for games. \hyperlink{a00026}{Yarn}'s very similar in style to \href{http://twinery.org}{\tt Twine}, so if you already know that, you'll be right at home! If you don't, that's cool -\/ \hyperlink{a00026}{Yarn}'s syntax is extremely minimal, and there's not much there to learn. The \hyperlink{a00026}{Yarn} language is used in a number of cool games, including \href{http://nightinthewoods.com}{\tt Night In The Woods} and \href{https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/foamsword/knights-and-bikes}{\tt Knights and Bikes}.

\begin{quotation}
$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-Important\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ \hyperlink{a00026}{Yarn} Spinner is still under development, and we haven't made our 1.\-0 release yet. It's {\itshape probably} fine to use right now, but there are a few bits and pieces that might change between now and first release.
