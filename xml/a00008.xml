It is strongly suggested you have first read through the <ref refid="a00211" kindref="compound">Simple Example</ref> document. Neither the Simple Example or this document talk about how to integrate <ref refid="a00051" kindref="compound">Yarn</ref> Spinner into your project; for that, see <ulink url="../YarnSpinner-Unity">&quot;Using Yarn Spinner in your Unity game&quot;</ulink>.</para><para></para></blockquote></para><para><heading level="2">Complex Example</heading>
</para><para>In our Complex Example, we will establish a multiple files of <ref refid="a00051" kindref="compound">Yarn</ref> Dialogue. This Dialogue will take place between three characters: the Player, an NPC called Sally and an NPC called Ship.</para><para>A limited amount of programming knowledge is required for narrative adventure <ref refid="a00051" kindref="compound">Yarn</ref> Dialogue creation, otherwise we cannot tell what is required to for the desired plot sequences to take place. In this example, we will introduce ***<ulink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_(computing">commands</ulink>)*** as well as ***<ulink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming">conditionals</ulink>)*** along with ***<ulink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_operator">tests</ulink>*** and ***<ulink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition_(computer_science">functions</ulink>)*** to produce a more reactive narrative. We shall also discuss ***<ulink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science">variables</ulink>)*** and how to use them to influence Dialogue interaction.</para><para><itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>***Commands*** instruct the game engine to execute specific code, such as making a noise in sequence with some text or generating a graphic or both (for example, displaying lightning and making the noise of thunder).</para></listitem><listitem><para>***Conditionals*** are a form of <ulink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_(computer_science">branches</ulink>). By following the <ref refid="a00211" kindref="compound">simple example</ref>, you&apos;ve already learned a little about <ulink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_(computer_science">control flow</ulink>), in that how selecting certain text determines which nodes to ***jump*** to. Conditionals are only slightly more complex than jumps, as they are simply a method to determine which jumps may become available and when.</para></listitem><listitem><para>***Tests*** utilise a combination of variables, functions to contruct a ***conditional***.</para></listitem><listitem><para>***Functions***, also known in other programming languages as subroutines, procedures, or subprograms, are an external set of commands that perform a specific task. In this example, we use a function called &apos;Visited&apos; to see if a node has been reached by a player in the context of a narrative story. Based upon this visit, or lack thereof, different narrative events take place.</para></listitem><listitem><para>***Variables*** hold pieces of information relating to the state of the game that may change depending on events happening in the game. For example, if a player picks up sticks the number of sticks can be stored in a variable called &apos;$sticks_collected&apos; <blockquote><para>***Note*** Variable names ***MUST*** always start with the $ character otherwise <ref refid="a00051" kindref="compound">Yarn</ref> Spinner will freak the crap out.</para><para></para></blockquote></para></listitem></itemizedlist>
</para><para><heading level="2">First Dialogue File</heading>
</para><para>First off, we&apos;ll create an initial scene. Because our Complex Example is set inside a space ship, we&apos;ll give the name of the node &apos;Ship&apos;. We&apos;ll give this node some initial Dialogue. ``` Ship: Hey, friend. Player: Hi, Ship. Player: How&apos;s space? Ship: Oh, man. ``` <heading level="3">Commands</heading>
</para><para>Next, we&apos;ll add a ***command*** to make the face of the ship change, the ship to say some text, then the ship return to neutral. ``` &lt;&lt;setsprite shipface=&quot;&quot; happy&gt;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Ship: It&apos;s HUGE! &lt;&lt;setsprite shipface=&quot;&quot; neutral&gt;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; ``` Do not be concerned that you do not have any graphics for the ShipFace. Nor, in fact, don&apos;t be too concerned if you&apos;d rather call the graphic FaceOfShip. In fact, the name can be anything. However to be compatible with the existing example, for comparison sake we are using ShipFace.</para><para>Our Dialogue now reads ``` Ship: Hey, friend. Player: Hi, Ship. Player: How&apos;s space? Ship: Oh, man. &lt;&lt;setsprite shipface=&quot;&quot; happy&gt;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Ship: It&apos;s HUGE! &lt;&lt;setsprite shipface=&quot;&quot; neutral&gt;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; ``` This is some simple introductory text for our Ship character, but it wouldn&apos;t make much sense to repeat this if our player has already visited Ship. So we will need to write a little bit of code to ensure that the second time we visit Ship, it acts differently. We need to check the state of having ***visited*** the ship.</para><para><heading level="3">Conditionals and Functions</heading>
</para><para><ref refid="a00051" kindref="compound">Yarn</ref> Spinner has an inbuilt ***function*** called <computeroutput>visited</computeroutput>. This function checks to see if a node has previously been accessed by the player. We can combine this function with a ***conditional*** to see whether a node has been previously displayed to the player. The basic syntax of such a conditional is: ``` &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;NodeName&quot;) is true&gt;&gt; NPC: You have visited me before, player &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; NPC: You have not visited me before, player &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; ``` <blockquote><para>***Note:*** The above can be re-written to provide the same outcome by reversing the test from true to false and inverting the NPC text:</para><para></para></blockquote>``` &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;NodeName&quot;) is false&gt;&gt; NPC: You have not visited me before, player &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; NPC: You have visited me before, player &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; ``` From this basic understanding of the ***&apos;if then else&apos;*** conditional, and usage of the <computeroutput>visited</computeroutput> function, we can then establish whether a player has visited Ship and change the Dialogue that Ship presents: ``` &lt;&lt;if visited(&quot;Ship&quot;) is false&gt;&gt; Ship: Hey, friend. Player: Hi, Ship. Player: How&apos;s space? Ship: Oh, man. &lt;&lt;setsprite shipface=&quot;&quot; happy&gt;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Ship: It&apos;s HUGE! &lt;&lt;setsprite shipface=&quot;&quot; neutral&gt;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;setsprite shipface=&quot;&quot; happy&gt;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Ship: Hey!! &lt;&lt;setsprite shipface=&quot;&quot; neutral&gt;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; ``<computeroutput> &gt;***Note:*** Remember, if we have</computeroutput>if visited(&quot;Ship&quot;) is true`, the order of the content of the ***&apos;if then else&apos;*** would need to be reversed to ensure the correct text is presented for when Player has previously visited Ship.</para><para>We will now add in some Dialogue that responds to whether we&apos;ve interacted with another NPC, Sally. Sally&apos;s nodes will be contained within a seperate text file for ease of editing purposes. You can contain all <ref refid="a00051" kindref="compound">Yarn</ref> Dialogue nodes in the same file but you will find that it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain as your file grows longer, so we strongly encourage this separation of characters. This is the remainder of the text required for the Ship Node of <ref refid="a00051" kindref="compound">Yarn</ref> Dialogue. ``` &lt;&lt;if $should_see_ship is true and $sally_warning is false&gt;&gt; Player: Sally said you wanted to see me? &lt;&lt;setsprite shipface=&quot;&quot; happy&gt;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Ship: She totally did!! &lt;&lt;setsprite shipface=&quot;&quot; neutral&gt;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Ship: She wanted me to tell you... Ship: If you ever go off-watch without resetting the console again... &lt;&lt;setsprite shipface=&quot;&quot; happy&gt;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; Ship: She&apos;ll flay you alive! &lt;&lt;set $sally_warning to true&gt;&gt; Player: Uh. &lt;&lt;setsprite shipface=&quot;&quot; neutral&gt;=&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt; <heading level="1">&lt;&gt; </heading>
</para><para>``` <heading level="3">Variables and Tests</heading>
</para><para>We can see from this code that there a couple of new things in this code snippet. They are <computeroutput>$should_see_ship is true</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>$sally_warning is false</computeroutput>.</para><para><computeroutput>$should_see_ship</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>$sally_warning</computeroutput> are examples of what are known as a ***variable***.

In simple terms, a boolean data type can hold one of two different states, true or false. By setting the variable to either of these two states and later evaluating it, determinations can be made as to which section of <ref refid="a00051" kindref="compound">Yarn</ref> Dialogue should be displayed.</para><para>We shall address the setting on the first boolean, <computeroutput>$should_see_ship</computeroutput>, in the nodes for the Sally character contained in the file <ulink url="../../Unity/Assets/YarnSpinner/Examples/DemoAssets/Space/Sally.yarn.txt">Sally.yarn.txt</ulink>. The boolean <computeroutput>$sally_warning</computeroutput> is set to <computeroutput>true</computeroutput> via the code <computeroutput>&lt;&lt;set $sally_warning to true&gt;&gt;</computeroutput> after Ship warns us that sally will flay us alive.</para><para><blockquote><para>***Note:*** We have now completed the <ref refid="a00051" kindref="compound">Yarn</ref> Dialogue for the Ship node.

Hi. Sally: You snuck up on me. Sally: Don&apos;t do that. &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; Player: Hey.
