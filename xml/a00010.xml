</para><para>Unity for Linux is not available in formal release and we are not actively pursuing this platform, however we are very enthusastic about this future prospect. We have confirmed that Yarnspinner works with the current 5.6 release of <ulink url="https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-on-linux-release-notes-and-known-issues.350256/">Unity for Linux</ulink>, although this has only been tested with our example Unity code on Debian Stretch (amd64 architecture).</para><para>We encourge Linux users to test Yarnspinner using the <ulink url="http://www.monodevelop.com/download/linux/">Monodevelop FlatPak</ulink>. Although FlatPak is designed to be Linux agnostic, we are currently utilising Gnome3 on Debian Stretch for desktop development purposes. Your mileage may vary on other Linux combinations and flavours, we are eager to receive your feedback.</para><para><heading level="2">Extending Tarnspinner</heading>
